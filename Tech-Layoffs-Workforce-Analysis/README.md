## Source Data

Located in `data/source_data/`:

- tech_layoffs_2025_2026.csv
- tech_hiring_trends_2025_2026.csv
- cleaned_tech_layoffs.csv

# SQL Workflow

The SQL workflow includes:

- Table creation
- Data validation
- Duplicate removal
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- KPI generation
- Tableau-ready query preparation
